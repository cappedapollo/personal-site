# Intro

I am a seasoned Senior Software Frontend Developer with over 10 years of experience in designing and implementing high-performance web applications. With a strong foundation in [React.js](https://react.dev), [Angular](https://angular.dev), and [Vue.js](vuejs.org) I have a proven track record of delivering intuitive, responsive, and dynamic user interfaces. My passion for UI/UX design ensures that I not only focus on the functional aspects but also the aesthetic and user-friendly elements of web applications.

# Some history

- In 1995, when I was just 5 years old, my parents bought a desktop computer for our home. It was a Packard Bell running Windows 95. I spent countless hours exploring its features and playing games like Minesweeper and Solitaire.

- In 1998, at the age of 8, I discovered the internet for the first time. I remember the excitement of hearing the dial-up modem connect and waiting patiently to browse websites.

- By 10 years old, I was already creating simple websites using HTML. I remember using Microsoft FrontPage to design my first site about my favorite Pok√©mon. It was crude, but it sparked a lifelong passion for web development.

- At 12, I taught myself JavaScript from online tutorials. I loved creating interactive web pages and was fascinated by how JavaScript could make websites dynamic and engaging.

- When I was 14, I started experimenting with CSS to style my websites. I enjoyed making my pages look visually appealing and learned how to create responsive designs.

- At 15, I joined a local coding club at school, where I met other students interested in programming. We would share tips, work on projects together, and help each other troubleshoot code.

- At 16, I built my first full-fledged web application using PHP and MySQL. It was a simple blogging platform that allowed users to register, post articles, and comment on posts.

- During my high school years, from 16 to 18, I participated in various hackathons and coding competitions. My team and I won several awards for our innovative projects, which motivated me to pursue a career in software development.

- At 18, before heading off to college, I secured an internship at a local tech startup. There, I gained practical experience in a professional setting, working on real-world projects and learning from experienced developers.

- From 2008 to 2012, I attended The Pennsylvania State University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my college years, I worked on various projects, including developing a campus event management system and a social networking site for students.

- After graduating in 2012, I started my professional career as a Full Stack Web Developer at Rivers Agile. Here, I honed my skills in the MERN/MEVN stack, working on end-to-end web applications and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

- In 2016, I joined Topcone Inc as a Front End Software Developer. Leading the design and development of interactive web applications for a Fortune 500 company, I focused on optimizing website performance and user experience.

- By 2021, I was promoted to Senior Software Engineer at VironIT. My role involved developing responsive web applications, implementing interactive features, and collaborating with designers and back-end developers to ensure seamless user experiences.

- Throughout my career, I've continuously updated my skills and knowledge in front-end technologies. My expertise includes JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React, Angular, Vue.js, and various other frameworks and libraries.

- Outside of work, I enjoy photography and have been capturing moments since I was 8 years old. My current gear includes a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally a Mamiya 6II.

- Today, I am a seasoned Senior Frontend Developer with over 10 years of experience. My passion for UI/UX design ensures that I focus not only on the functional aspects of web applications but also on their aesthetic and user-friendly elements.
